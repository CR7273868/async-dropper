<h1 align="center">ðŸ—‘  <code>async-dropper</code></h1>

`async-dropper` is probably the least-worst ad-hoc `AsyncDrop` implementation you've seen, as a trait called `AsyncDrop` and corresponding [derive macro][rust-derive-macro].

The code in this crate was most directly inspired by [this StackOverflow thread on Async Drop](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71541765/rust-async-drop) and many other conversations:

- [Async Drop? - Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/vckd9h/async_drop/)
- [Asynchronous Destructors - rust-lang.org](https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/asynchronous-destructors/11127)
- [Async Drop roadmap](https://rust-lang.github.io/async-fundamentals-initiative/roadmap/async_drop.html) (once this is done, this crate will be deprecated!)

## Install

```console
cargo add async-dropper                      # by default, tokio is enabled
cargo add async-dropper --features async-std # use async-std
```

If you're editing `Cargo.toml` by hand:

```toml
[dependencies]
async-dropper = "0.1"
#async-dropper = { version = "0.1", features = [ "async-std" ] }
```

> **Warning**
> `async-dropper` does not allow using both `async-std` and `tokio` features at the same time (see [the FAQ below](#FAQ)).

## Quickstart

To see `async-dropper` in see [`examples/tokio.rs`](./examples/tokio.rs), the code is reproduced below:

```rust
use std::{
    result::Result,
    sync::{Arc, Mutex},
    time::Duration,
};

use async_dropper::AsyncDrop;

#[derive(Debug, Error)]
enum ExampleError {
    #[error("not done counting yet")]
    NotDoneCountingError,

    #[error("mutex encounted a poison error")]
    MutexPoisonError,
}

/// This object will be async-dropped
///
/// Objects that are dropped *must* implement Default and PartialEq
/// (so make members optional, hide them behind Rc/Arc as necessary)
#[derive(Default, PartialEq, AsyncDrop)]
struct ExampleObj(&str);

/// Implementation of AsyncDrop that specifies the actual behavior
#[async_trait]
impl AsyncDrop for ExampleObject {
    async fn drop(&self) -> Result<(), AsyncDropFailure> {
        // Wait 2 seconds then "succeed"
        tokio::sleep(Duration::from_secs(2)).await;
        eprintln!("dropping [{}]!", self.0);
        Ok(())
    }

    fn drop_timeout() -> Duration {
        Duration::from_secs(5) // extended from default 3 seconds
    }

    // NOTE: below was not implemented since we want the default of DropFailAction::Contineue
    // fn drop_fail_action() -> DropFailAction;
}

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let example_obj = ExampleObj("test");
    eprintln!("here comes the (async) drop");
    drop(example_obj);

    Ok(())
    // Another drop happens after the function, but that one will be a no-op
}
```

You can run the example and see the output:

```console
cargo run --example tokio --features=tokio
```

## Supported environments

`async-dropper` works with the following async environments:

| Name                              | Supported? |
|-----------------------------------|------------|
| Async w/ [`tokio`][tokio]         | âœ…         |
| Async w/ [`async-std`][async-std] | âœ…         |

[async-std]: https://crates.io/crates/async-std

## FAQ

### Why does `async-dropper` assume that I'm using *either* `async-std` or `tokio`

Because you probably are. If this is a problem for you, it *can* be changed, please file an issue.

## Development

To get started working on developing `situwatiion`, run the following [`just`][just] targets:

```console
just setup build
```

To check that your changes are fine, you'll probably want to run:

```console
just test
```

If you want to see the full list of targets available that you can run `just` without any arguments.

```console
just
```

There are a few useful targets like `just build-watch` which will continuously build the project thanks to [`cargo watch`][cargo-watch].
